# Dot File Repo

My dotfiles.

The aim is to have a way to run all this very quickly on any server.
Right now I have two scripts here which work for the following rc files:
-> gitconfig
-> bashrc
-> screenrc
-> tmux.conf

The bashrc also has some niceties where it loads from the dotfiles/bash directory all the rc files. This makes all this much more readable.

There are two setup scripts:

- copy_rcs.sh
    - This copys all the rc files into place in $HOME. It also saves backups of the current in <file>_bk
- restore_rcs.sh
    - This restores the <file>_bk saved in the previous script.

Both scripts take one of the following arguments: "tmux", "vim", "git", "screen"

If no argument supplied all will be copied.
